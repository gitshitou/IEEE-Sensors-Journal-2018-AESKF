%QUATERNION2NAUTICAL Calculates euler angles from unit quaternion as per
%described in "Representing Attitude: Euler Angles, Unit Quaternions, and 
%Rotation Vectors" - Author: James Diebel, Stanford University 20 October 
%2006. This sequence is often referred to as cardan angles, tait-bryan
%angles or nautical angles. They are also referred to as euler angles in
%aeronautics which creates the confusion.
%Phi   <-> roll  <-> bank     (rotation about x)
%Theta <-> pitch <-> attitude (rotation about y)
%Psi   <-> yaw   <-> heading  (rotation about z)
%[phi_roll,theta_pitch,psi_yaw] = quaternion2nautical( q )
%{'\phi;','\theta';'\psi'}
%Body fixed x axis - Forward direction is along the body
%Body fixed y-axis is starboard    (to the right)
%Body fixed z-axis points downward (to the ground) 
%The home position [0,0,0] is flat level pointing along the world x-axis.
%i.e. north. 
%Whilst defined for A NED reference frame, also suitable for an 
%Up-North-West reference frame in which:
%Body fixed x axis - Forward direction is along the body
%Body fixed y-axis is port (to the left/west)
%Body fixed z-axis points upward (to the sky) 

%Algorithm as per described in section 5.6.3 Euler Angles <= Rotation 
%Matrix, page 11. 
%
%Remember! Rotation matrices can be thought of as the matrix of basis 
%vectors that define the world and body-fixed coordinate systems. The rows
%of the rotation matrix are the basis vectors of the body-fixed coordinates
%expressed in world coordinates, the columns are the basis vectors of the
%world coordinates expressed in the body fixed coordinates

%NB: q must be a 4 column vector
